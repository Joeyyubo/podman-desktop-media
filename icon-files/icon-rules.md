# Icon Unity

The different icon libraries and the documentation listed below were reviewed - focusing on how they keep them consistent with each other and guidelines for building a new icon for the set. 

- [Material Design](https://m2.material.io/design/iconography/system-icons.html) 
- [IBM UI](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/iconography/ui-icons/design/)
- [Font Awesome](https://docs.fontawesome.com/web/add-icons/upload-icons/icon-design)

The following has been taken from them and adapted to meet our needs.

## Table of Contents
- Foundation
- Padding
- Key shapes
- Style 
- Stroke
- Corners
- Angles

## Foundation 
- The square base grid is 32 x 32 px.
- Blank 32 x 32px SVG file can be downloaded [here.]()

## Padding 
- Have atleast 2px padding around each icon to make sure it has surrounding white space. 

## Key shapes 
- Use consistent sizes for basic shapes or proportions. Icons are to reuse the same shapes to add harmony. 
- Inkscape SVG files with guides can be found [here.](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop-media/tree/design-assets/icon-files/templates)

> Example of key shapes from IBM icon guidelines.

## Shape
- Dimensions
	- Square: 
24 px by 24 px
	- Circle:
24 px by 24 px
	- Rectangle (Vertical):
20 px by 28 px
	- Rectangle (Horizontal):
28 px by 20 px

## Style
- Simplify icons for clarity and legibility.
- Icons should be stroke by default. Only use fill if concept cannot be conveyed in stroke.

## Strokes
- Maintain the same visual weight by using a 2px stroke for all icons. 
- There should not be different weights within one icon.
- Stroke terminal should be rounded.
- Stroke should not be converted to path to stroke.
- Stroke should be center aligned.

> Types of stroke alignment.
## Corners
- Use a consistent corner radius of 2px for rounded shapes.
- The 2px radius can be increased by a multiple of two when necessary to make the icon’s metaphor understandable or object shape clearly defined. 
- Interior corners should not be rounded.
- Use rounded arrow tips.

> Example of rounded arrow tips.
## Angles
- Use 45° angles for even anti-aliasing. 
- Use increments of 15° whenever possible for other angles needed to best depict the shape you’re creating for your metaphor.
